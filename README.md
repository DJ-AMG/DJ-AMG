Hi I'm Alan

During the day Senior Software Engineer with exposure to a diverse range of technologies. Fully experienced with all aspects of the software life cycle - from development and implementation to testing and debugging. Specializing in C++ and C# within Visual Studio 2022.

C++ utilising STL, Qt, Open Scene Graph using Git for source control.

C# within the .NET environment utilising WPF and the Revit SDK.

Evenings and weekend music enthusiast and wannabe DJ. I started DJing a few years back, dabbling occasionally on a Pioneer DDJ-400 with my trusty laptop and Rekordbox. In 2022 I upgraded to the XDJ-RX3 and stated practising in earnest. Despite only having a two-channel mixer the RX3 is an awesome bit of kit. Recently upgraded to a full CDJ & DJM set up. My next gig will be at UK Trance Societyâ€™s Aurora Event in London on 27th April 2024. Huge honour to be supporting XiJaro & Pitch who will be dropping a 3-hour set!
